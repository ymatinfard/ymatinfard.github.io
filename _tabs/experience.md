### Baam App
- Played a key role in the development and architectural design of a high-impact product with over **10 million installations**.
- Led the transition of the codebase from Java to Kotlin and refactored the project architecture from MVP to Clean Architecture with MVVM, resulting in improved code readability and maintainability.
- Accelerated the build process, reducing build time by **up to 30%** through the implementation of **modularization and Gradle cache**.
- Redesigned the application dashboard to enable **dynamic, server-side feature management**. .
- Enhanced the user interface design, leading to a **4.35% improvement in user satisfaction** (rating increased from 4.6 to 4.8).
- Consistently paired with and mentored **two junior developers** on the team.

At **Sadad Informatics Corporation**, a leading payment solution provider and part of Bank Meli, the largest bank in Iran, I had the privilege to contribute to the growth of an application that serves more than **10 million users**. Working with a talented team of 7 Android developers, we followed Scrum methodology to deliver high-impact features.

One of my key responsibilities was leading the transition of the project from **Java to Kotlin**, significantly improving the codebase’s readability and maintainability. I also took on the task of migrating parts of the app’s user interface from traditional XML to **Jetpack Compose**, enhancing the overall user experience and allowing for more modern, scalable UI solutions.

Another important task I contributed to was the implementation of **server-driven UI** for the main part of the application, enabling **dynamic customization per user**. This not only simplified **A/B testing** but also allowed us to handle **feature flags** efficiently, ensuring that features could be rolled out gradually and any potential failures managed with ease.
