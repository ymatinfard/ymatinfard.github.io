### Baam App
- Played a key role in the development and architectural design of a high-impact product with over 10 million installations.
- Led the transition of the codebase from Java to Kotlin and refactored the project architecture from MVP to Clean Architecture with MVVM, resulting in improved code readability and maintainability.
- Accelerated the build process, reducing build time by up to 30% through the implementation of modularization and Gradle cache.
- Redesigned the application dashboard to enable dynamic, server-side feature management.
- Enhanced the user interface design, leading to a 4.35% improvement in user satisfaction (rating increased from 4.6 to 4.8).
- Consistently paired with and mentored two junior developers on the team.

At **Sadad Informatics Corporation**, a leading payment solution provider and part of Bank Meli, the largest bank in Iran, I had the privilege to contribute to the growth of an application that serves more than **10 million users**. Working with a talented team of 7 Android developers, we followed Scrum methodology to deliver high-impact features.

One of my key responsibilities was leading the transition of the project from **Java to Kotlin**, significantly improving the codebase’s readability and maintainability. I also took on the task of migrating parts of the app’s user interface from traditional XML to **Jetpack Compose**, enhancing the overall user experience and allowing for more modern, scalable UI solutions.

Another important task I contributed to was the implementation of **server-driven UI** for the main part of the application, enabling **dynamic customization per user**. This not only simplified **A/B testing** but also allowed us to handle **feature flags** efficiently, ensuring that features could be rolled out gradually and any potential failures managed with ease.

At Exbito, a startup in the cryptocurrency industry, I was one of two Android developers who took on the challenge of building the company's Android app from scratch. Exbito was a **data-intensive project** that required strong knowledge of state management and concurrency. To handle real-time data effectively, I worked extensively with **WebSockets and Kotlin coroutines**, deepening my expertise in these areas.

Performance and user experience were core values that shaped our development process. As a financial application where users managed their funds, we were highly committed to reliability and **security**. Writing comprehensive tests was a priority; we aimed for full coverage of business-critical features to ensure our users' trust and the app's stability.

In the fast-paced startup environment, I gained valuable experience in concurrency management, performance optimization, and **rigorous testing** standards—skills that have significantly enhanced my abilities as a Senior Android Developer.

#### ZDFMediathek App
- Developed the application based on provided specifications, ensuring alignment with project requirements.
- Executed the migration of specific project components to Kotlin, enhancing codebase efficiency and modernization.
- Conducted UI reorganization to enhance user experience, incorporating custom views to elevate the application's look and feel.
- Proactively addressed and resolved production and QA issues.

At FFW(cellular) Company, a software solution provider company in Germany, I worked on developing the ZDFMediathek app, which allows users to stream content from ZDF, a popular German TV channel. This role was a unique opportunity to dive into the media streaming domain, where I gained hands-on experience with **ExoPlayer**, a powerful video player library crucial for smooth, high-quality streaming.

During my time on the project, I focused on building and refining **custom views** to enhance the user experience. Streaming applications demand a seamless interface that’s both functional and visually engaging, so I crafted custom UI components to provide users with an intuitive and enjoyable experience. I also worked on integrating new features to improve the app's overall functionality, ensuring that it not only met but exceeded user expectations in a competitive streaming environment.

One of the exciting aspects of this role was developing for **Android TV**, where I adapted the ZDFMediathek app for a different screen format and interaction style. Android TV required unique layout adjustments and UX considerations to ensure that the app looked and worked smoothly on larger screens, all while maintaining an optimized streaming experience. This adaptation process taught me a great deal about optimizing applications for different device types and screen sizes, especially in a media context where resolution and responsiveness are key.
