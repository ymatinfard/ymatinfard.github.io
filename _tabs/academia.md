### Master of Science in Computer Engineering
**Azad University, Tehran, Iran**  
2016â€“2018

#### Thesis: "Task Offloading in Mobile Devices Using Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC)"
- Investigated solutions for overcoming the limitations of resource-constrained mobile devices, such as limited battery life, processing power, and storage, when executing computation-heavy tasks.
- Proposed a framework for offloading tasks from mobile devices to nearby devices or cloud resources, enhancing performance and efficiency.
- Focused on a multi-objective optimization approach to allocate tasks effectively, minimizing task completion time and energy consumption while adhering to quality-of-service (QoS) constraints.

### Achievements
- Participated in the ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) Regional Contest in 2009 as a member of the Tabriz Technical College team.
