# About Me

I am an Android Developer, and I enjoy developing Android applications using **Kotlin** on **Android Studio**, but I also have some experience developing with **Dart/Flutter** on Visual Studio. I am always striving to learn about new technologies, best practices, and techniques that make developing with Kotlin and Android easier, more structured, and easily scalable. My previous experience includes working with **Spring Boot** to create simple web applications.

My journey into the Android seas began at the start of 2015, with the rise of the mobile-first design approach. I became part of a talented team of developers, creating high-quality code and exploring the vast seas of **RxJava**, **TDD**, and much more.
